# Fatman

Graphical front-end developed in C, GTK, and Glade for Arch Linux's command line package manager _pacman_, as part of the activities and project of the course of _Design and Development of Human-Computer Interaction_ of the degree of _Computer Engineering_ in 2020, _Universidad Nacional del Sur_.

# Details

This project focuses on the conception, design and development of the user interface of the system, based on the input and feedback of the software intended users, without necessarily developing the communication between the GUI and the subjacent command line package manager. It is an example on how to design an application based on the intended users' input and feedback.

Every directory contains a part of the different stages of development of the project:
- Identify similar software systems and possible users
- Conduct a survey to determine exactly what functionality the user wants from systems like these
- Perform use cases for every functionality determined by the users in the survey
- Make UML diagrams for every use case
- Sketch the software possible screens, following the UML diagrams
- Develop the system prototype
- Lastly, a video (in Spanish) shows the basic functionality of the graphical interface
